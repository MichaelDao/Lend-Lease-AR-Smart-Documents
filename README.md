# We won $4000 AUD and were granted the "Most Innovative Solution" award
Our team developed a smart document manager to help [LendLease](https://www.lendlease.com/au/) employees solve a problem surrounding the "leveraging of knowledge" with “Augmented Reality”.

Our pitch was loved by the judging panel and we were awarded the most innovative solution by [Hendry](https://www.hendry.com.au/).

We finished in 2nd place against all the other competitive teams with their industry problems and we were granted $4000 AUD for our prize.
